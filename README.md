# EATPLANZY

This Django project is a website that showcases recipes sourced from the BBC dataset. It serves as a platform for users to explore and share their favorite recipes. As a part of my learning journey, I've incorporated features such as user authentication, profile management, recipe creation, liking, and commenting. Users can also connect with each other through messaging.

The app was build with a goal to practice Python, Django and Object Oriented Programming. The main focus was on the backend part. I realize that the code can be cleaner and more efficient but I am still a beginner and I build these projects to improved and get better.
